		Notes on CSV Files
		------------------

The CSV files in this directory were fetched from ftp.posc.org/pub/geodetics.
The changes.txt, and code_ndx.csv file didn't come from the same source, and
may not apply to these CSV files.  These CSV files relate to the EPSG data
model when GeoTIFF was first published, and don't reflect the current state
of the EPSG database.  Work is underway to create a new set of CSV files from
the new EPSG database which would live within the libgeotiff tree itself. 

Paul Jenson maintains a cleaned up form of the old CSV files at:
